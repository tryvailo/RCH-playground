He has Vascular Dementia and needs help with his 'daily needs', such as washing & shaving, dressing etc. He has a lovely room with its own toilet and sink, so he can maintain his own continents. He loves the food (which smells lovely). And the staff are great company and are friendly towards him. My dad joins in daily activities which he enjoys and is taken out regularly so he gets fresh air and fun. Westgate House have a lovely garden, which is lovely for visitors to sit out with the resident. I have had a whole year of 'Peace of mind' knowing my dad is well cared for and in a safe place.",
