# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Initial Git Setup

1. **Initialize Git repository:**
```bash
cd /Users/alexandertryvailo/Documents/Products/RCH-playground
git init
```

2. **Add all files (sensitive files are already in .gitignore):**
```bash
git add .
```

3. **Verify sensitive files are NOT staged:**
```bash
git status
# Make sure config.json, .env files, and test results are NOT listed
```

4. **Create initial commit:**
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: RCH Playground project"
```

5. **Create repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `RCH-playground` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "RightCareHome API Testing Suite and Playground"
   - Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
   - Click "Create repository"

6. **Connect local repository to GitHub:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RCH-playground.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Before Pushing - Final Security Check

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Before pushing, verify these files are NOT in the repository:

```bash
# Check if config.json is tracked (should return nothing)
git ls-files | grep config.json

# Check if .env files are tracked (should return nothing)
git ls-files | grep "\.env"

# Check if test results are tracked (should return nothing)
git ls-files | grep "test_results"

# View all files that will be committed
git ls-files
```

If any sensitive files appear, remove them:
```bash
git rm --cached path/to/sensitive/file
```

## Important Notes

- ✅ `config.json.example` is safe to commit (no real keys)
- ✅ `env.template` is safe to commit (no real keys)
- ❌ `config.json` is in .gitignore (will NOT be committed)
- ❌ `.env` files are in .gitignore (will NOT be committed)
- ❌ `venv/` and `node_modules/` are in .gitignore
- ❌ Test result files are in .gitignore

## After Setup

1. Update `README.md` with your GitHub repository URL
2. Add collaborators if needed
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
4. Configure branch protection rules (recommended)
