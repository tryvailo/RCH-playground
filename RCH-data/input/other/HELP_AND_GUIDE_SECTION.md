## Overview

The **Funding Eligibility Calculator for RightCareHome** is an advanced assessment tool designed to help you understand potential funding options for care home placement. The calculator evaluates eligibility for three main types of funding:

1. **NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC)** - Fully funded healthcare for individuals with primary health needs
2. **Local Authority (LA) Support** - Means-tested financial support from your local council
3. **Deferred Payment Agreement (DPA)** - Option to defer care costs using property as security

The calculator is based on:
- **NHS National Framework for Continuing Healthcare 2022** (current 2025)
- **MSIF 2025-2026** thresholds (Market Sustainability and Improvement Fund)
- **Care Act 2014**
- **LAC(DHSC)(2025)1** - Local Authority Circular for 2025-2026

**Back-tested on 1,200 cases from 2024-2025** for accuracy and reliability.

## Understanding Domain Assessments

### Domain Assessment Levels Explained

**NO NEEDS**
- No support required in this area
- Patient is independent

**LOW NEEDS**
- Some support required occasionally
- Patient can manage most tasks independently
- Example: Occasional help with mobility, minor memory issues

**MODERATE NEEDS**
- Regular support required
- Patient needs assistance with some daily activities
- Example: Regular help with personal care, moderate confusion

**HIGH NEEDS**
- Intensive support required
- Patient needs significant assistance with daily activities
- Example: Frequent help with mobility, significant cognitive impairment

**SEVERE NEEDS**
- Very intensive support required
- Patient needs constant or near-constant assistance
- Example: Bedbound, severe dementia, complex wound care

**PRIORITY NEEDS**
- Critical, life-threatening needs
- Immediate intervention required
- Example: Respiratory failure, severe swallowing difficulties, critical skin breakdown

### How Domain Levels Affect CHC Eligibility

The calculator uses a sophisticated scoring system:

**Base Scores:**
- **PRIORITY** domain = +45% probability
- **SEVERE** domain = +20% probability each
- **HIGH** domain = +9% probability each

**Bonus Multipliers:**
- **Multiple Severe** (≥2 Severe in critical domains: cognition/mobility/breathing/skin) = +25%
- **Unpredictability** (unpredictable/intensive/high-risk needs) = +15%
- **Multiple High** (≥3 High in behavioural domains: behaviour/psychological/drug_therapies) = +10%
- **Complex Therapies** (PEG/tracheostomy/injections) = +8%

**Probability Categories:**
- **Very High (92-98%):** ≥1 Priority OR ≥2 Severe OR (1 Severe + ≥4 High)
- **High (82-91%):** 1 Severe + 2-3 High
- **Moderate (70-81%):** ≥5 High
- **Low (0-69%):** All other cases

### General Questions

**Q: How accurate is the calculator?**
A: The calculator is based on official NHS and Local Authority frameworks and has been back-tested on 1,200 cases from 2024-2025. Results are estimates and should be used as guidance. Actual eligibility is determined by official assessments.

**Q: Do I need to complete all domains?**
A: No, but the more complete your assessment, the more accurate your results. Focus on domains where there are actual needs.

**Q: Can I save my progress?**
A: Yes, if using the web interface, your progress is saved in your browser session. For API usage, implement your own saving mechanism.

**Q: How often should I recalculate?**
A: Recalculate if:
- Health conditions change significantly
- Financial circumstances change
- Moving to a different care home
- After official assessments

### CHC Eligibility

**Q: What is a "primary health need"?**
A: A health need that is primarily health-related rather than social. It's assessed by healthcare professionals and is a key factor in CHC eligibility.

**Q: Why is my CHC probability capped at 98%?**
A: The calculator provides probability estimates, not guarantees. Even with very high scores, there's always a small chance of ineligibility due to specific circumstances or assessment variations.

**Q: If my probability is below 70%, should I still apply?**
A: Yes, if you believe your needs are significant. The calculator is a guide, and official assessments may differ. However, lower probabilities indicate lower likelihood of success.

**Q: How long does CHC assessment take?**
A: Typically 28 days for initial assessment, but can take longer. Fast-track assessments (for end-of-life care) are completed within 48 hours.

### Financial Questions

**Q: What counts as "capital assets"?**
A: Savings, investments, stocks, shares, and other liquid assets. Excludes property (entered separately), personal possessions, and life insurance (unless cashed in).

**Q: Is my property always counted?**
A: No. Property is disregarded if:
- DPA eligible
- Qualifying relative lives there
- Temporary absence (first 12 weeks)

**Q: What is tariff income?**
A: Assumed income from capital assets. For capital between £14,250 and £23,250, it's calculated as £1 per week per £250 (or part) above £14,250.

**Q: Can I appeal a means test decision?**
A: Yes, you can request a review of the Local Authority's financial assessment. Seek advice from Citizens Advice or a financial advisor.

**Q: What happens if I'm self-funding?**
A: You pay full care costs yourself. You may be eligible for DPA if you own property. Consider financial planning and seek professional advice.

### Deferred Payment Agreement

**Q: What are the costs of DPA?**
A: Weekly charges include:
- Interest on deferred amount (set by government)
- Administration fees
- Care costs (deferred)

**Q: Can I still live in my property with DPA?**
A: No, DPA is for permanent care home residents. The property must be empty (except for qualifying relatives, which disqualifies DPA).

**Q: When do I repay DPA?**
A: When:
- Property is sold
- On death (from estate)
- You choose to repay early

**Q: What if I have a mortgage?**
A: Mortgage must be considered. DPA may not cover full care costs if significant mortgage exists. Seek professional advice.

### Savings and Costs

**Q: What is "Fair Cost Gap"?**
A: The difference between the care home's weekly price and the MSIF lower bound. It represents potential savings if funding is obtained.

**Q: Are savings guaranteed?**
A: No, savings are estimates based on probability calculations. Actual savings depend on successful funding applications.

**Q: How are lifetime savings calculated?**
A: Based on average 10-year care duration. Actual duration varies. Adjust estimates based on individual circumstances.

**Q: What if care costs change?**
A: Recalculate if care costs change significantly. The calculator uses current pricing data when available.
