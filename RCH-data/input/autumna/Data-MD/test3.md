###### Meet The Manager

**Zoe Steventon** is Home Manager at Edgbaston Manor.

At Edgbaston Manor, teamwork is at the heart of everything we do. We support each other to provide the highest standards of care and to make our home a happy, welcoming place for residents and families alike. My door is always open if you’d ever like to share any feedback or simply have a chat.

I’ve been a Registered Nurse for more than 18 years and have more than 12 years of experience working in care homes. Throughout my career, I’ve learned that being a good manager means leading with compassion, patience and resilience, while supporting everyone in the home to do their very best.

Outside of work, I love spending time with my family, especially my daughter, and visiting my favourite place in the world, Cornwall.

## Infection Control (S.A.F.E.)

Autumna has invited care providers to evidence the infection control measures they are carrying out, above and beyond those laid out by the government, in order to keep residents, staff and visitors safe.

| What we're doing to keep residents & visitors safe |
| --- |
| Since the early stages of the pandemic, our teams have been working to a pandemic plan which is updated regularly to reflect any changes to either UK or Scottish government guidance. This plan includes a range of measures aimed at both reducing the likelihood of new Covid-19 infections and reducing the spread of infections where they occur. |

| Infection Control Initiatives in place |
| --- |
| ![safe-tick](https://cdn.autumna.co.uk/autumna/prod/static/img/safe_tick.png) | **Air Filtration & Purification** | We are using air filtration and/or air purification devices within our care setting. |
| ![safe-tick](https://cdn.autumna.co.uk/autumna/prod/static/img/safe_tick.png) | **Independent Assessments** | We have been independently assessed in our approach to infection control. |
| ![safe-tick](https://cdn.autumna.co.uk/autumna/prod/static/img/safe_tick.png) | **Infection Control Training** | Our staff are trained to use measures which prevent and control infections. |
| ![safe-tick](https://cdn.autumna.co.uk/autumna/prod/static/img/safe_tick.png) | **Infection Screening** | We are using technology to screen for infections & monitor symptoms. |
| ![safe-tick](https://cdn.autumna.co.uk/autumna/prod/static/img/safe_tick.png) | **Regulatory Assessment** | We have been assessed by the care regulator in our approach to infection control. |
| ![safe-tick](https://cdn.autumna.co.uk/autumna/prod/static/img/safe_tick.png) | **Sterilisation & Disinfection Devices** | We are using sterilisation and/or disinfection devices within our care setting. |

| Safe Visiting Space |
| --- |
| |     |     |
| --- | --- |
| ![safe-tick](https://cdn.autumna.co.uk/autumna/prod/static/img/safe_tick.png) | **We have a safe visiting space** |
| All Care UK homes now have purpose-built internal or external visiting suites available which enable visits to take place from behind a sealed glass panel, using a sound system to assist with communication. Where Government guidance and local health teams allow, these suites make it possible to continue visiting even when we have a case of Covid-19 in the home. | |  |

| Connectivity for resident testing, monitoring & communications |
| --- |
| Infection control and the safety of both residents and staff often requires quarantine measures and the isolation of care home residents. To test, monitor and allow residents to communicate with relatives, the prevalence of room-level connectivity within the home is becoming increasingly relevant.<br> <br>**Wireless Internet access (WiFi)**<br> <br>Yes, our care home has WiFi in all our resident’s rooms.<br> <br> <br>**Mobile Phone Network Coverage (mobile “signal”)**<br> <br>Yes, our care home has mobile phone signal in all our resident’s rooms.<br> <br> <br>**Telephone for external calling**<br> <br>Yes, our care home provides a telephone in all our resident’s rooms. |

## Provider Newsfeed

Social media provides an up to date window on the activities within a provider's setting.

With the restrictions on visiting during the pandemic, social media platforms such as these offer real insight when you are choosing a provider.
